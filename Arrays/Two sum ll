    LeetCode 167: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

    Given a 1-indexed array of integers 'numbers' that is already sorted in
    non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific
    target number.

    Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as a list [index1, index2].
    Exactly one solution exists, and the same element cannot be used twice.

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
